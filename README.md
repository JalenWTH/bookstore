# bookstore (unfinished)
Bookstore practice project made to help me learn how to use relational databases. A user can make order books from the bookstore. When a book is ordered, information about the order is added to the database.

## Virtual Environment
It is good practice to use a <a href='https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/python-virtual-environment/'>virtual environment</a> when working with Python. To create a virtual environment (assuming {Python is already installed), first create a new directory. Inside this directory, run the Python command for creating a virtual environment from the command prompt:

`python3 -m venv /path/to/new/virtual/environment`

The path can simply be the name you choose for your virtual environment. Inside this virtual environment you need to copy over your Python installation. After that point the command prompt to your python installation within the virtual environment and install Django using:

`pip install Django=4.0.4`
